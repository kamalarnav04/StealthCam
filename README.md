## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn
- Modern web browser with WebRTC support
- Camera and microphone access for streaming

### Installation

1. **The project is already set up in your current directory**

2. **Install additional dependencies if needed:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment variables are already configured in `.env.local`**
   - In production, change the secrets to secure random strings

4. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Open the application:**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
   - The application will automatically detect your device type

## Usage Guide

### Step 1: Authentication
1. Open the application in your browser
2. Enter a username and password (new users are automatically registered)
3. Select your device type:
   - **Computer**: For streaming (captures video/audio)
   - **Mobile**: For viewing (receives video/audio)

### Step 2: Computer Setup (Streaming)
1. Login with device type set to "Computer"
2. Grant camera and microphone permissions when prompted
3. Select your preferred stream quality
4. Click "Start Stream" to begin broadcasting
5. Your mobile devices will be notified

### Step 3: Mobile Setup (Viewing)
1. Login with the same username on your mobile device
2. Set device type to "Mobile"
3. Tap "Request Stream" to start receiving video
4. Use the controls to adjust volume, mute, or go fullscreen

### Stream Quality Options
- **Low**: 640x480 @ 15fps - Good for slow connections
- **Medium**: 1280x720 @ 30fps - Balanced quality and performance
- **High**: 1920x1080 @ 30fps - Best quality, requires good connection
